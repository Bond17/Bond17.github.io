My history with software development actually goes back a long time now.


When I went to the College I thought I wanted to be some type of engineer. However after a year of calculus and memorizing formulas I decided it was silly forcing my brain to memorize so many formulas and do large scale math on paper when computers could do the math in microseconds. I thought back to the programs I had written on my graphing calculator in high school. Mostly menu based games at first I had learned how to write formulas where you could input a few variables and get the calculation. I would then make a menu so you could access multiple formulas. 

 Programming has fascinated me since high school when i used to write programs to help with algebra on my TI-84 calculator. I even learned how to make menus and limited graphics for interactive games. I think the limited resources on the TI-84 made it a fun challenge to design code that worked around the limitations of only having 10 variables and 10 images to work with. I think that experice was part of what helped me decide on computer science as my major.

In the next four years along with general programming skills: I learned a lot about data structures, algorithms and Big O notation. While these skills are very useful in some fields It was not what struck my passion for a career path. I would like to be involved with more user oriented software rather than systems software that few people directly interact with. 

Now, I am ready to grow myself with Flat Iron's unique approach to learning software development. So far I have been able to put my experience from college to work, and I feel like I am learning a lot more in a shorter period of time than I did in school. I am excited to learn about totally new concepts for me like Javascript, Rails and React.
